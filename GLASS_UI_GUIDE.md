# 🎨 Glass UI Status Cards - Navigation Guide

## ✨ **Enhanced Glass Effect Applied!**

I've just enhanced the glass UI effect with:
- **Stronger blur**: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` 
- **Better colors**: Semi-transparent overlays with status-based coloring
- **Glass shimmer**: Hover animation with light sweep effect
- **Enhanced shadows**: Multi-layered depth with inset highlights

## 📍 **Where to See the Status Cards**

The main **system status cards** (ESP32, MQTT, Supabase, Device Discovery) with the new glass effect are on the **main Dashboard page**.

### **To See Them:**

1. **Navigate to Dashboard Home**:
   - Click the **home/dashboard icon** in the top navigation
   - Or go directly to: `http://localhost:3001/`

2. **Look for the Status Cards Section**:
   - You'll see 4 colored glass cards:
     - 🔴 **ESP32 Controller** (Red glass if error)
     - 🔴 **MQTT Broker** (Red glass if disconnected) 
     - 🟢 **Supabase Database** (Green glass if connected)
     - 🟡 **Device Discovery** (Yellow/orange glass if warning)

## 🎯 **What You'll See Now**

### **Glass Effect Features:**
- ✅ **Blur background** - Cards blur content behind them

## 🛠 **Current Page**

You're currently viewing a **device card** (showing database connection error). I've also applied the glass effect to this card, so you can see:
